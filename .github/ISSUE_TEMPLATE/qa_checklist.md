## üì± **Responsive Design**

### Mobile (< 768px)
- [ ] **Landing page hero section stacks properly:** Open https://easylayer.io, resize browser to 375px width (or use DevTools Device Toolbar with iPhone setting) - verify hero title, subtitle, and code blocks stack vertically and remain readable
- [ ] **Navigation collapses to hamburger menu:** On mobile view, look for hamburger menu icon (three lines) in header - click it and verify navigation menu slides out/drops down with all menu items accessible
- [ ] **Text is readable without horizontal scroll:** On mobile view, scroll through entire page - verify no text extends beyond screen width causing horizontal scrolling, all content fits within viewport
- [ ] **Buttons and links easily tappable:** On mobile view, try tapping all "Learn more" buttons and links - verify they're large enough (minimum 44px touch target) and have adequate spacing between them
- [ ] **Docs sidebar becomes collapsible menu:** Navigate to https://easylayer.io/docs on mobile - verify sidebar converts to collapsible hamburger menu or slide-out panel, doesn't overlap main content
- [ ] **Blog posts are readable on mobile:** Open any blog post on mobile view - verify text flows properly, code blocks scroll horizontally if needed, images scale to fit screen width
- [ ] **Footer stacks vertically and remains functional:** Scroll to footer on mobile - verify footer links stack in single column, all links remain clickable with adequate touch targets

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] **Layout adapts gracefully between mobile and desktop:** Resize browser from 768px to 1024px width - verify layout transitions smoothly without sudden jumps, content reflows naturally between breakpoints
- [ ] **Sidebar behavior appropriate for screen size:** On docs pages at tablet width, verify sidebar either remains visible alongside content or collapses appropriately, doesn't create cramped reading experience
- [ ] **Feature cards arrange in appropriate grid:** On landing page features section at tablet width, verify 6 feature cards arrange in 2x3 or 3x2 grid (not single column or awkward layout)
- [ ] **Navigation remains usable:** Test navigation menu at tablet width - verify all menu items are accessible, no overlap or crowding issues, touch targets remain adequate

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- [ ] **Full layout displays without horizontal scroll:** On desktop view (1920px+ width), verify entire page content fits within viewport width, no horizontal scrollbar appears at bottom of browser
- [ ] **Sidebar and main content display side-by-side:** On docs pages at desktop width, verify sidebar takes fixed width on left, main content fills remaining space on right, both visible simultaneously
- [ ] **Maximum content width prevents overly long lines:** On wide screens, verify text content has maximum width (around 800-1200px) so lines don't become unreadably long across entire screen width
- [ ] **All interactive elements have hover states:** On desktop, hover over buttons, links, navigation items - verify visual feedback like color changes, underlines, shadows, or other hover effects appear

**Comments:**
```
[Test using browser dev tools responsive mode + physical devices if available]

- [ ] **Internal links use proper anchor text:** Throughout site, check that link text is descriptive ("Learn more about State Modelling" not just "click here"), gives context about destination page
- [ ] **URL structure is clean and semantic:** Check URLs like /docs/getting-started, /blog/article-name - verify they're readable, don't contain query parameters or IDs, follow logical hierarchy

### Meta Tags & Social

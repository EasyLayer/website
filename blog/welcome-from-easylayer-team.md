Welcome to EasyLayer! We're excited to introduce you to a framework that changes how you work with blockchain data. But first, let's answer the main question.

## What is EasyLayer?

EasyLayer is a **framework for building self-hosted blockchain data indexers**. Think of it like building a regular Node.js backend, but for parsing and monitoring blockchain data.

Here's how it works:
- You install our package (like [@easylayer/bitcoin-crawler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@easylayer/bitcoin-crawler))
- You describe **what data you need** from the blockchain using a simple model
- You run your Node.js project
- That's it. Everything else works under the hood.

No need to store the entire blockchain. No need to build complex infrastructure. Just describe your data model in the format our framework provides, and we handle the parsing, indexing, and storage.

Why is this a framework? Because you only write the model - your business logic about what data matters. We've already built everything under the hood: connections to nodes, block processing, data storage (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or IndexedDB out of the box), APIs, real-time updates, and more. You handle the deployment yourself, but all the heavy lifting is done.

## Why Should Your Business Care?

Let's talk money and resources. Every business working with blockchain faces the same problems:

**Problem 1: Expensive API services**  
Third-party blockchain APIs charge you for every request. Scale up your app, and costs skyrocket. Plus, your data lives on someone else's servers.

**Problem 2: Building custom solutions**  
Hiring a team to build blockchain infrastructure? That's months of development, ongoing maintenance, and specialized developers who don't come cheap.

**Problem 3: Complex and expensive infrastructure**  
Building your own indexing solution means setting up nodes, synchronization logic and dealing with blockchain-specific challenges. It's complex and costly.

**EasyLayer solves all three:**
- **Self-hosted** = your servers, your data, no recurring API fees
- **Framework approach** = small team, fast development, works like regular backend
- **Smart indexing** = only stores data you actually need, efficient node communication

One virtual server with 2-3 CPUs is enough. Your database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or IndexedDB for browser) stays with you. Your data stays secure and private.

## Who Needs This?

Do you need blockchain data in your business? Specifically - transactions, smart contract events, token transfers, balance changes, or any other on-chain activity? Then you need EasyLayer.

- **Fintech companies**: Track payments, maintain transaction history, comply with regulations
- **Gaming platforms**: Monitor deposits, withdrawals, verify fairness with full event history  
- **DeFi platforms**: Index smart contract events, track token movements, analyze liquidity
- **Exchanges and wallets**: Sync blockchain state, monitor transactions, process confirmations
- **Analytics companies**: Build custom blockchain explorers and data dashboards
- **Compliance teams**: Maintain complete audit trails with Event Sourcing

If you're currently paying for blockchain APIs or considering building custom infrastructure, EasyLayer is your answer.

## Our Mission

Blockchain technology shouldn't require a team of specialists. Integration shouldn't take months. Costs shouldn't scale exponentially.

We believe blockchain data should be accessible to any development team. You shouldn't need to choose between expensive API services and building everything from scratch.

Our mission is simple: **remove the barriers** between developers and blockchain data. Make it as straightforward as working with any other database or API in your stack.

The blockchain revolution isn't just for crypto companies. It's for every business ready to build transparent, auditable, decentralized applications. But the technology barrier is real. We're here to remove it.

Think about it: why should reading transaction data be harder than querying PostgreSQL? Why should you store terabytes of irrelevant blockchain data? Why should you pay monthly fees for data you could host yourself?

You shouldn't. That's why we built EasyLayer.

## What's Next?

Ready to try it yourself? Here's where to start:

- **Read the [documentation](/docs)**: Step-by-step guides to build your first blockchain indexer in minutes

We're continuously expanding:
- Multi-chain support (Bitcoin-like, EVM-like, Solana, TON)
- Performance optimizations  
- More transport options
- Enhanced monitoring tools

Welcome to EasyLayer! We're thrilled to introduce you to our tools that're set to revolutionize how businesses work with blockchain technology. Our mission is simple yet ambitious: make blockchain integration so effortless that businesses can focus on what they do best instead of wrestling with complex infrastructure.

We're building the tools that remove the technical barriers between your business and the blockchain universe. Think of us as your blockchain integration wingman – we handle the heavy lifting so you don't have to lose sleep over RPC endpoints, block heights, or data synchronization nightmares.

## Why EasyLayer?

Here's the thing – the current blockchain tooling landscape is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture with instructions written in ancient Sanskrit. Existing solutions are either too rigid, too expensive, or simply don't work when you need them most.

We're changing that game completely. EasyLayer offers:

- **Self-hosted, ready-to-deploy applications**: Your infrastructure, your rules, your data. No vendor lock-in, no mysterious third-party dependencies
- **Intelligent blockchain crawlers**: Monitor and index any blockchain data – both historical archives and real-time streams – with surgical precision
- **Developer-friendly data modeling**: You define what data matters to your business, we handle the extraction, transformation, and delivery via your preferred transport (HTTP RPC, IPC, WebSocket, TCP)
- **Open-source transparency**: Every line of code is open for inspection. Want to see how we solved that tricky consensus mechanism? Go ahead, peek under the hood

What makes us unique? We're building blockchain crawlers that actually understand your business needs. Instead of forcing you to adapt to rigid APIs, our tools adapt to your data models. You describe what you want to track, and our crawlers figure out how to get it from the blockchain nodes efficiently.

Plus, we're planning to expand beyond monitoring – wallet applications with transaction capabilities are on the roadmap to make blockchain transactions as simple as sending an email.

## Our Vision

Web3 is incredible technology, but let's be honest – it's still rocket science for most businesses. We believe blockchain adoption shouldn't require a PhD in cryptography or a team of blockchain wizards.

Our vision is a world where integrating blockchain functionality into your business is as straightforward as adding a payment processor or analytics tool. We want to democratize access to blockchain technology, making it accessible to startups, enterprises, and everyone in between.

We're not just building tools; we're building bridges. Bridges that connect traditional business logic with the decentralized future, without requiring you to burn down your existing infrastructure and start from scratch.

The blockchain revolution shouldn't be exclusive to crypto natives – it should empower every business ready to embrace the future of digital commerce, data ownership, and decentralized applications.

## What's Next?

We're not sitting idle – our roadmap is packed with exciting developments:

- **Multi-chain expansion**: Rolling out support for EVM-compatible chains, Solana, and TON networks
- **Documentation overhaul**: Creating comprehensive guides, tutorials, and examples that actually make sense
- **Performance optimization**: Because nobody has time for slow blockchain queries
- **Reliability improvements**: Building the kind of infrastructure you can set and forget

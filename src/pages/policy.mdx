## Introduction

EasyLayer is an open-source blockchain framework. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information through our website (easylayer.io). 

**Important:** When you deploy EasyLayer's packages (@easylayer/bitcoin-crawler, etc.), all blockchain data and application data stays entirely on YOUR infrastructure. We never see, access, or collect data from your self-hosted deployments.

## What We Are

We are an open-source project providing npm packages that you install and run on your own servers. We are NOT a cloud service or SaaS platform.

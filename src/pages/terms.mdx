If you modify AGPL-licensed packages and:

- Include all scripts needed to build and run your version

**"Network use" includes:**
- Public APIs
- Internal company services

- Any remote access to your modified crawler

**Failure to comply** is copyright infringement. We take AGPL compliance seriously and may pursue legal action for violations.

## 15. Termination

We reserve the right to:

## Summary (Not Legal Advice)

**In plain English:**
- Our software is open source - check each package's license
- Website terms are standard "don't be evil" rules
- Software is "as is" - no warranties, test before production
- AGPL packages require you to share modifications if you offer network services
- MIT packages are very permissive - use freely
- We're not liable for damages - standard OSS protection
- You control your data - it's self-hosted
- Questions? Ask us before assuming!

**Not a lawyer?** Neither are we! This is our best effort at fair terms, but when in doubt, consult your legal counsel, especially regarding AGPL compliance.

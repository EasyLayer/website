## AGPL-3.0 License (Copyleft)

### Packages
- @easylayer/bitcoin-crawler
- Other blockchain crawler packages

### What You Can Do
✅ Use commercially  
✅ Modify  
✅ Distribute  
✅ Private use  

### What You MUST Do
If you run modified AGPL software as a **network service**:
- **Publish your complete source code**
- License modifications under AGPL-3.0
- Provide prominent notice to users
- Include build and installation instructions
- Make source available over the network

### What is "Network Service"?
- ✅ HTTP APIs using the crawler
- ✅ Internal company services accessed remotely
- ✅ SaaS offerings
- ✅ WebSocket endpoints
- ✅ Any remote access by users

### What is NOT "Network Service"?
- ❌ Running crawler locally on your laptop
- ❌ Desktop application (no network access)
- ❌ Using unmodified version

### The Key Difference from GPL
**GPL:** Only share if you distribute binaries  
**AGPL:** Share if users interact over network

This prevents "SaaS loophole" where companies run modified GPL software as services without sharing improvements.

### Why We Chose AGPL for Crawlers

We want Bitcoin Crawler improvements to benefit everyone. AGPL ensures:
- Commercial use is allowed ✅
- But improvements come back to community ✅
- Can't create proprietary forks as services ❌
- Fair exchange: use our work, share yours back ✅

### AGPL Compliance Examples

**✅ Compliant:**
- Using unmodified @easylayer/bitcoin-crawler
- Modifying crawler for local/desktop use
- Publishing your modifications on GitHub under AGPL
- Contributing improvements back to EasyLayer

**❌ Non-Compliant (Copyright Violation):**
- Modifying crawler, offering it as API, not sharing code
- Creating proprietary SaaS using modified crawler
- Running modified crawler in company without publishing source
- Claiming to comply but hiding actual running code

- Need proprietary features
- Require support and indemnification

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use @easylayer/bitcoin-crawler in my company internally?**  
A: Yes! But if employees/users access it over a network (even internal), you must publish your modifications.

**Q: I haven't modified the crawler, just configured it. Must I share?**  
A: No. Configuration files and custom models you write aren't modifications. AGPL applies to crawler code itself.

**Q: Can I run AGPL crawler behind my API without sharing?**  
A: No. API is network service. You must publish modifications.

**Q: Can I sell services using AGPL crawler?**  
A: Yes! AGPL allows commercial use. But you must share your code.

**Q: What if I just use it locally?**  
A: No obligation to share. AGPL only triggers on network use.

**Q: How do I properly comply with AGPL?**  
A: 
1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Publish your modifications there
3. In your service, link prominently to your fork
4. Ensure your fork includes build instructions

**Q: Can I get sued for AGPL violation?**  
A: Yes. AGPL violations are copyright infringement. We take compliance seriously.
